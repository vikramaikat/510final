# 510final

### TO DO
* Make sure sequential, basic parallel, and gpipe have similar loss histories.
* Add some profiling stuff
* Evaluate test set loss
* Implement basic local learning


### File Summaries

#### models/utils.py
This file is used to store functions that are useful across models. Here we have the basic structure
for the neural net, the loss plot and the performance plot functions.

#### models/no_op.py
Define a No-Op Pytorch Module that will be useful for caching gradients.

#### models/gpipe_model.py

#### models/distributed_model.py

#### models/basic_distributed_model.py

#### data/xor_data.py

#### temp_plot_outputs folder
